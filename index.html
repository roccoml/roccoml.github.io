<h2>Welcome</h2>

<div class="content">
    <div class="intro">
    <p>My name is Rocco Lawson, I am 21 years old, and a Gemini.</p>
<p>I go to the University of Colorado - Leeds School of Business and am studying Business Analytics and Real Estate with a minor in Creative Technology and Design. I plan to graduate in May of 2023, and shortly after will start my career at Deloitte as a Government & Public Services Risk & Financial Advisory Analyst.</p>
<p>Outside of school, I model and am highly obsessed with fashion. I am signed in Denver, New York, Los Angeles, and Miami, and travel for modeling year round. Check out the modeling tab on my website to see some of my work. </p>
<p>In my free time, I love thrift shopping and trying new restaurants with the people I love. I enjoy watching horror films, anime, or anything A24. Some of my favorite A24 movies are Hereditary, Everything Everywhere All At Once, Bodies Bodies Bodies, and Men. I also love to paint with watercolors and create handmade beaded jewelry that coordinates with my outfits. I am incredibly passionate about music and play the synthesizer for fun. Some of my favorite artists include Arca, Shygirl, The Garden, Animal Collective, Beyonc√©, Junglepussy, and Coco & Clair Clair.</p>
<p>This website is to highlight my education and work experience, while also displaying a little bit about me personally. Enjoy your stay.</p>
